# java-wfc-image

> This project is under construction.

This is a small demo project showing how to use the wave function collapse (wfc) algorithm.

It uses the java-wfc (jwfc) library, which you can find [here](https://github.com/GameplayJDK/java-wfc).

It also demonstrates how to use the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) pattern with Java Swing GUI applications.

## Installation

To set up the application, simply download the latest release [here](https://github.com/GameplayJDK/java-wfc-image/releases).

## Usage

> Open TODO:

Screenshots will be visible here soon.

## Build

Currently there are some manual steps required to compile this project yourself.

First of all, it requires Java version 8.

As java-wfc is a required dependency, please download the latest release from the repository page linked above. After
that you can add the jar as a dependency to your build artifact.

_**Note**: A maven package for the dependency will be available as soon as the main wfc package is stable._
